# **Line-Follower-Robot**

## **Description**
The Line-Follower-Robot is an advanced robotics project combining the capabilities of:
- **Line Following**: Using sensors to follow a path on the ground.
- **Color Recognition**: Detecting and identifying colors on its path.
- **Custom Circuitry**: Includes a designed PCB for the entire system, ensuring compactness and efficiency.

This project is ideal for understanding embedded systems, robotics algorithms, and PCB design.

## **Features**
1. **Line Following**:
   - Tracks lines using multiple sensors for precise movement.
   - Implements various motor control strategies for sharp turns and corrections.
2. **Color Recognition**:
   - Identifies red, green, and blue colors using a TCS3200 color sensor.
   - Displays detected color and sensor readings on an LCD.
3. **Custom PCB**:
   - Compact and efficient design integrating all components.
   - Reduces wiring complexity for better performance and reliability.

## **Program Flow**
1. **Initialization**:
   - Setup pins for sensors, motors, and ultrasonic modules.
   - Initialize SD card for logging movement data.
2. **Line Following**:
   - Sensors detect the line and determine the robot's position relative to it.
   - Motors adjust speed and direction to keep the robot on track.
3. **Color Recognition**:
   - The TCS3200 color sensor detects the current surface color.
   - Data is displayed on an LCD and sent to the serial monitor.
4. **Obstacle Detection**:
   - Ultrasonic sensors detect obstacles ahead.
   - Robot stops if an obstacle is within a critical distance.
